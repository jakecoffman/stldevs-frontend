      This site is a listing of St Louis based designers and developers based on what they have created.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site harvests public information from Github. If a user on Github has self-identified as being
      from St. Louis, they are included here. Eventually there will be an option to opt out, but that isn't
      implemented yet.
    </p>

    <p>Some potential future features are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>awards and badges</li>
      <li>a job board</li>
      <li>other integrations (bitbucket, etc)</li>
    </ul>
